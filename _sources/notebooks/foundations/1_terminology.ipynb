    "## Overview\n",
    "Great circles are powerful tools used in the navigation of ships and planes as well as in geoscience for working with remote sensing via satellites. Great circle mathematics make use of spherical geometry, where, rather than lines, shapes on a sphere are formed by the intersection of arcs along the curved surface.\n",

    "While spherical geometry played an important role historically in the fields of astronomy and navigation, its teaching has largely fallen out of favor since the 1950's making finding comphrenshive resources difficult.\n",
